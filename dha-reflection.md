GPS 1.1 : Reflection
==================

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I had been struggling with the general workflow. There have been times where I have just worked on the `master` branch instead of checking out a feature branch. Throughout the GPS session, I got more familiar with using a feature branch, and then submitting a pull request, and pulling down from the remote to my local master. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The GPS session gave me more clarity into the overall workflow and why it is important to follow in that manner. I am much more confident now in maintaining the Git workflow and being consistent with it.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my guide (who was also my pair) questions pertaining to deleting a branch on GitHub as well as locally; I was confused about Git merge conflicts; I also asked about `git fetch`. 

* What still confuses you about Git?

I am still not completely confident in particular cases of merge conflicts, but I imagine it will become easier as I stumble upon them in the future.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was awesome! Naturally I was a bit nervous heading into the session, but my guide (and also pair) Laura was amazing! She was super nice, knowledgeable, gave me great feedback, and was generally just great to work with.
